## RPC Setup
You need to download the RPC for the coin you want to setup the bot with, for example, Dragonglass (https://github.com/ZirtysPerzys/dragonglass/releases). Unzip it to whereever you built the TIPBOT.

## Deamon setup
Next you'll need to open the daemon for the coin, for example, `dragonglassd` for DRGL Dragonglass.

The file structure should look like this:
* dragonglassd
* dragonglass-wallet-rpc
* TIPBOT <- This programs executable. 
* Wallets/ <-- this is a directory. This will be created after running TIPBOT.

## Discord Token Setup
Navigate to "My Apps" on Discord (https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/me). 
Click new app, give it a name and description. 
Click create a bot user.
Copy the token generated on that page and open TIPBOT and enter it when prompted.
To add a bot user to your account you'll need to get the client id for the bot which is also on that page. 
Then navigate to this url (https://discordapp.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=CLIENTID&scope=bot) and replace CLIENTID in the url with the client url on the page.

The bot should now be ready to run. Launch it, enter the token, and type `!balance` and if it returns a balance of 0 then the communication between the bot and the RPC is working correctly.
